I keep getting this error from discord about my hosted bot, what does this mean?

"discord.gateway: Shard ID None heartbeat blocked for more than 40 seconds."
Here is my bots code, can you refactor it to fix this?

"async def send_message(message, user_message, is_private):
    try:
        response = responses.handle_response(user_message)
        if len(response) > 2000:
            # Split the response into smaller chunks of no more than 2000 characters each
            response_chunks = [response[i:i+2000]
                               for i in range(0, len(response), 2000)]
            for chunk in response_chunks:
                # Send each chunk separately
                await message.author.send(chunk) if is_private else await message.channel.send(chunk)
        else:
            await message.author.send(response) if is_private else await message.channel.send(response)

    except Exception as e:
        print("my exception", e)"
